\arguments{
\item{burnableexposure}{A SpatRaster of exposure, non-burnable cells should
be removed using optional parameter \verb{no_burn = }in \code{\link[=fire_exp]{fire_exp()}}.}

\item{fires}{A SpatVector of observed fire perimeters}

\item{aoi}{(Optional) A SpatVector that delineates an area of interest}

\item{class_breaks}{(Optional) vector of numeric values between 0-1 of the
upper limits of each class. The default is \code{c(0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1)}. See
details.}

\item{samplesize}{Proportion of areas to sample. The default is \code{0.005}
(0.5\%)}
}
\value{
a table of number of cells (n) and proportions (prop) of exposure
classes within a sampled area (Sample) and across the full extent (Total).for
the full extent of the exposure data (expected) and only within the burned
areas (observed).
}
\description{
For advanced users. \code{fire_exp_validate()} compares the
proportion of exposure classes in a the study area to the proportion of
exposure classes within observed burned areas.
}
\details{
This function automates a simple validation method to assess if fire burns
preferentially in areas with high exposure. The methods, and figure produced
with \code{\link[=fire_exp_validate_plot]{fire_exp_validate_plot()}}, are based on Beverly et al. (2021).

The function requires an exposure raster produced for a past point in time.
Cells that cannot burn, or do not represent natural land cover should be
removed by setting the \code{no_burn} parameter in \code{\link[=fire_exp]{fire_exp()}} or
\code{\link[=fire_exp_adjust]{fire_exp_adjust()}}.

The function also requires fire perimeter data. Currently, the function takes
the fires as a Vector of polygons because that is typically how fire
boundaries are stored in spatial databases. The fires input data should
include all of the burned area that has occurred following the time period
the input exposure layer was produced for. It is up to the user to determine
the appropriate amount of burned area required for a meaningful assessment.

A random sample is taken to account for spatial autocorrelation, the
sampled location results can be used to test for significant differences.
The sample size can be adjusted. The sample size represents a proportion of
cells, the default is \code{0.005} (0.5\%). It is the user's responsibility to set
an appropriate sample size.

The class breaks can be customized from the default of 0.2 intervals by
setting the \code{class_breaks} parameter. A class of Nil is automatically added
for values exactly equal to 0.

# PLEASE NOTE THIS EXAMPLE DATA DOES NOT GENERATE MEANINGFUL RESULTS

# compute exposure and remove non-burnable cells
exposure <- fire_exp(hazard, no_burn = no_burn)
