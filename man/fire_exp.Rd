\title{Compute the wildfire exposure metric}
\usage{
fire_exp(hazard, tdist = c("l", "s", "r"), no_burn)
}
\arguments{
\item{hazard}{a SpatRaster that represents hazardous fuels for the
transmission distance specified in tdist}

\item{tdist}{a character vector, can be: \code{"l"} for long-range
embers (Default), \code{"s"} for short-range embers or, \code{"r"} for radiant heat}

\item{no_burn}{(optional) a SpatRaster that represents the non-burnable
landscape. Any cells that cannot receive wildfire (e.g. open water, rock)
and any cells that are not natural (e.g. built environment,
irrigated agricultural areas) should be of value 1, all other cells
should be NODATA. This parameter should be provided if preparing data
for \code{\link[=fire_exp_validate]{fire_exp_validate()}}}
}
\value{
A SpatRaster object of exposure values between 0-1
}
\description{
\code{fire_exp()} returns a SpatRaster of wildfire exposure values calculated
using the input hazard fuel raster for a specified transmission distance.

\details{
This function is the primary function in this package, the output from this
function serves as the first input to all other functions in this package.
\subsection{Background}{

Wildfire exposure was first proposed for community scale assessments by
Beverly et al. (2010). Wildfire entry points to the built environment were
identified by evaluating the surrounding wildland fuels as potential ignition
sources. These methods were adapted and validated by Beverly et al. (2021)
for landscape scale assessments. Visual aids to better understand these
concepts are available in the Wildfire Exposure Assessment Guidebook
(FireSmart Canada 2018) which includes intuitive illustrations.

Three transmission distances were defined in Beverly et al. (2010) for
different scales of wildfire ignition processes. Different fuel types
are capable of transmitting fire at different scales. The transmission
distances define a potential maximum spread distance from an ignition
source. If the default distances do not accurately represent fire behaviour
in your area of interest you can adjust them with \code{\link[=fire_exp_adjust]{fire_exp_adjust()}}.
\subsection{Radiant heat}{

The default transmission distance for radiant heat is 30 meters. At this
scale of wildfire transmission wildfire can spread from direct flame contact
or thermal radiation warming of fuels.
}

\subsection{Ember spotting}{

Embers (AKA firebrands) can be carried by wind beyond the active fire front.
To determin two different ember spreading distances Beverly et al. (2010)
reviewed fire-spot distance observations and applied predictive models to
verify these distances were a reasonable assumption.
\subsection{Short-range embers}{

The default transmission distance for short-range embers is 100 meters. Some
fuel types have the potential to produce embers over short distances. An
example fuel type that has the potential to transmit short-range embers is
a deciduous forest. Fuels considered hazardous to short-range ember ignition
will also be hazardous to transmit fire via radiant heat or direct flame
contact.
}

\subsection{Long-range embers}{

The default transmission distance for long-range embers is 500 meters.
Some fuel types have the potential to transmit embers across large distances.
This landscape scale process is often a contributor to large, fast-moving
fires. Any fuels that are considered hazardous for long-range ember spotting
could also transmit fire by short-range ember spotting and radiant heat. An
example fuel type that has the potential to transmit long-range embers is a
mature pine stand.

Although it is possible for embers from certain fuel types to be carried
much farther than the defined 500 meter transmission distance under extreme
conditions, these cases are relatively uncommon.

The 500 meter spread distance has been further validated across Alberta
(Beverly et al. 2021), in Alaska (Schmidt et al. 2024), across the entire
Canadian landbase (manuscript in preparation), and in Portugal (manuscript
in preparation).

\subsection{Technical}{
\subsection{How the metric is calculated}{

The wildfire exposure metric is calculated for each cell individually using a
focal window of the surrounding cells within the specified transmission
distance. The proportion of cells within the assessment window that are
classed as hazardous is returned. The wildfire exposure metric has a range
of 0-1. A wildfire exposure value of 0.5 can be interpreted as 50\% of cells
within the specified transmission distance area have the potential to
spread fire to the assessment cell. A value of 0.5 can also be interpreted
in the other direction, a fire in the assessment cell could potentially
spread to 50\% of the surrounding cells within the specified transmission
distance.
}

\subsection{Input features}{

An input hazard raster must be prepared by the user in accordance with the
intended use. First, refer to the Get Started vignette by running
\code{vignette("fireexposuR")} to determine what the data requirements are for
the intended application. Then refer to the Preparing Input Data vignette by
running \code{vignette("prep-input-data")} for lots of recommendations, advice,
and examples.

A separate hazard raster should be prepared for each of the transmission
distances of interest. There are also minimum spatial resolution and extent
requirements for each transmission distances.

Long-range embers:
\itemize{
\item minimum raster resolution is 150 meters
\item The dimensions of the data must be wider/taller than 1000 meters because
500 meters of data will be lost along the perimeter due to edge effects
}

Short-range embers:
\itemize{
\item minimum raster resolution is 33 meters
\item The dimensions of the data must be wider/taller than 200 meters because
100 meters of data will be lost along the perimeter due to edge effects
}

Radiant heat:
\itemize{
\item minimum raster resolution is 10 meters
\item The dimensions of the data must be wider/taller than 60 meters because
30 meters of data will be lost along the perimeter due to edge effects
}
}

\subsection{Spatial Reference}{

The exposure raster will be returned in the same CRS as the input hazard
layer. A crs must be defined if the outputs will be used in other functions
in this package.
