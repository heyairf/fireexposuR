## Further reading and resources

Wildfire exposure research news and course offering announcements are posted on the Wildfire Analytics website

* [wildfireanalytics.org](https://wildfireanalytics.org)

This guidebook provides a basic and easy to read overview of wildfire exposure assessments with very helpful graphics

* FireSmart Canada (2018) Wildfire exposure assessment guidebook. Available [here](https://firesmartcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FS_ExposureAssessment_Sept2018-1.pdf)

This paper introduced key concepts about wildfire exposure and transmission distances. The guidebook above is based on this research product. Please note that this is the only resource behind a paywall.

This paper validated the wildfire exposure metric at a landscape scale with observed fire history in the province of Alberta, Canada. Different methods for defining hazardous fuels, and ember spread distances are explored. Results are also compared to outputs from other wildfire models.

This paper introduces the directional exposure assessment methodology. It explains why the default values were chosen for the assessment.

This paper investigates the sensitivity of wildfire exposure assessments to different land cover information products used to create the input hazardous fuel data at local scales
