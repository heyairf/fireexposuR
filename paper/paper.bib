	abstract = {Wildfires are a natural part of forest ecosystems, but sometimes pose a threat to communities. In Canada, when public safety is threatened by a wildfire encroaching into the wildland-urban interface (WUI), fire management agencies will recommend that local authorities evacuate the area. If a fire spreads quickly towards a community and egress capacity is insufficient, public safety can be compromised. This paper presents an interdisciplinary approach for assessing community directional vulnerabilities for wildfire evacuation, combining techniques from wildland fire science and transportation engineering. For a selection of communities in Alberta that were assessed as being potentially vulnerable to wildfire, we explored the directional configuration of the transportation network in relation to a directional assessment of wildfire exposure. We first plotted the viable fire pathways and transportation facility characteristics, and then compared estimated fire encroachment times against estimated community egress times, directionally around each community to show evacuation vulnerabilities. Our results show that some communities, mainly within the Boreal Forest, Foothills and Rocky Mountain natural regions, have egress routes that are highly exposed to potential wildfire encroachment. Our findings also indicate that the evacuation timing for some larger communities needs attention, given relationships between estimated fire travel times and evacuation times. The results can be used to inform evacuation preparedness planning and proactive mitigation efforts.},

Ignition processes generated by burning vegetation that were included in the analysis were radiant heat, short-range spotting, and longer-range spotting. Results were used to map the boundaries of the wildland–urban interface and to delineate zones within each community that identify the degree to which these areas represent potential wildfire entry-points into the wildland–urban interface. The assessment method can be used to set priorities for mitigation activities; compare conditions within and between communities and over time; and identify priority areas for time- and resource-intensive site assessments that are often completed for individual structures located in the wildland–urban interface. We compared results among the four case-study communities and demonstrated an application of the approach for evaluating community fuel treatment plans. Factors that influenced the exposure of the built environment to potential ignition sources differed among the communities, which suggested the need for community-specific mitigation strategies. Spatial patterns of areas with elevated ignition exposure reflected not only the amount of ignition-producing vegetation around the built environment, but also the size and arrangement of fuel patches in relation to the unique morphology of the community and the occurrence of occluded interface zones.},

	abstract = {Abstract

              Context
              Proximity of landcover elements to each other will enable or constrain fire spread. Assessments of potential fire propagation across landscapes typically involve empirical or simulation models that estimate probabilities based on complex interactions among biotic and abiotic controls.


              Objectives

                We developed a metric of landscape fire exposure based solely on a grid cell’s proximity to nearby hazardous fuel capable of transmitting fire to its location. To evaluate accuracy of this new metric, we asked:
                Do burned areas occur preferentially in locations with high exposure?



              Methods
              We mapped exposure to hazardous fuels in Alberta, Canada using a neighbourhood analysis. Correspondence between exposure and 2331 fires that burned 2,606,387 ha following our 2007 assessment was evaluated and exposure changes between 2007 and 2019 were assessed.


              Results
              In all eleven ecological units analysed, burned area surpluses occurred where exposure was ≥ 60\% and corresponding deficits occurred where exposure was {\textless} 40\%. In seven ecological units, the majority of burned areas had pre-fire exposure ≥ 80\%. Between 2007 and 2019, land area with exposure ≥ 80\% increased by almost a third.


              Conclusions
              Exposure to hazardous fuels is easily quantified with a single thematic layer and aligns well with subsequent fires in Boreal, Foothills and Rocky Mountain natural regions. The resulting fire exposure metric is a numeric rating of the potential for fire transmission to a location given surrounding fuel composition and configuration, irrespective of weather or other fire controls. Exposure can be compared across geographic regions and time periods; and used in conjunction with other metrics of fire controls to inform the study of landscape fire.},

	abstract = {Wildfires spread along trajectories set by a coincident wind direction. Despite the highly directional nature of wildfire threats to public safety, landscape fire risk assessments are typically omnidirectional. We used a simple metric of landscape fire exposure to develop a systematic and standardized approach for assessing directional vulnerability to wildfire within a circular assessment area centered on locale of interest. First, we defined a viable wildfire trajectory by analyzing 573 sample trajectories delineated within the burned areas of historical fires in the province of Alberta, Canada. On average, sample trajectories intersected locations assessed as having high wildfire exposure for 79\% of their length. We, therefore, defined a viable fire trajectory as one with at least 80\% of its length traversing high exposure. Using this criterion, we assessed the viability of directional trajectories representing possible wildfire pathways from outlying landscape areas into a locale of interest centered within a roughly 70,000-ha circular assessment area. At each central assessment point (i.e., community centroid), we delineated 360 linear trajectories into the community at 1° directional intervals. Each 15-km trajectory was divided into three 5-km segments for analysis (inner, middle, and outer). The length of each directional trajectory segment that intersected high exposure was computed for all 1080 directional segments in each community assessment area. In total, we evaluated 986,040 directional segments for 913 communities in the province. Communities exhibited highly unique and varied patterns of directional vulnerabilities to wildfire encroachment. Of the communities analyzed, 136 had at least one continuous viable trajectory spanning the full 15-km distance from the community centroid, and 211 communities had at least one continuous viable trajectory spanning 5–15 km from the community centroid. We developed customized rose or polar diagrams for displaying spatially referenced directional vulnerabilities to wildfire for a given community and combined results for all 913 analyzed communities to assess regional vulnerabilities within administrative management areas (i.e., Forest Areas). Potential applications of our directional assessment method are discussed, including prepositioning and prioritizing limited fire suppression resources, planning fuel reduction treatments, proactively identifying candidate locations for operational activities, assessing transportation network vulnerabilities during evacuations, and scenario planning.},

	abstract = {Increased wildfire activity has raised concerns among communities about how to assess and prepare for this threat. There is a need for wildfire hazard assessment approaches that capture local variability to inform decisions, produce results understood by the public, and are updatable in a timely manner. We modified an existing approach to assess decadal wildfire hazards based primarily on ember dispersal and wildfire proximity, referencing landscape changes from 1984 through 2014. Our modifications created a categorical flammability hazard scheme, rather than dichotomous, and integrated wildfire exposure results across spatial scales. We used remote sensed land cover from four historical decadal points to create flammability hazard and wildfire exposure maps for three arctic communities (Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska and Whitehorse, Yukon). Within the Fairbanks study area, we compared 2014 flammability hazard, wildfire exposure, and FlamMap burn probabilities among burned (2014–2023) and unburned areas. Unlike burn probabilities, there were significantly higher in exposure values among burned and unburned locations (Wilcoxon; p {\textless} 0.001) and exposure rose as flammability hazard classes increased (Kruskal–Wallis; p {\textless} 0.001). Very high flammability hazard class supported 75\% of burned areas and burns tended to occur in areas with 60\% exposure or greater. Areas with high exposure values are more prone to burn and thus desirable for mitigation actions. By working with wildfire practitioners and communities, we created a tool that rapidly assesses wildfire hazards and is easily modified to help identify and prioritize mitigation activities.},

	abstract = {Fuel management is undertaken to mitigate the adverse consequences of wildfire. Finite mitigation budgets demand selective prioritization of forest stands for targeted fuel reduction treatments. A range of modeling methods have been used to identifiy optimal fuel treatment plans at various spatial and temporal scales of investigation; however, strategic analysis of fuel management alternatives can involve a range of limitations and challenges, including the prevalence of one-time solutions, static models lacking dynamic adaptability, and challenges in accounting for the stochastic nature of fire behaviour. To navigate these complexities, our study combines remote sensing-based analysis with a random search optimization algorithm to inform strategic fuel management and wildfire mitigation planning. For two communities in Alberta, Whitecourt and Hinton, we assessed landscape fire exposure within and around the built environment and rated hazardous fuels by the number of buildings they exposed (i.e., Building Exposure load, BEL). Through the assessment of BEL and the outcomes of the optimization algorithm, our model identified key areas for intervention, enabling a more informed allocation of mitigation resources. We found good alignment between expert-derived fuel treatment areas and our model-derived fuel reduction areas, PFRs, confirming the utility and relevance of our findings. The methodology is adaptable to diverse regional fuel characteristics and it also offers a phased implementation to assisting communities with financial constraints. The suggested systematic approach aids communities that lack local expertise in developing proactive fuel treatment strategies. Additionally, this study emphasizes the need to combine fuel treatment prioritization with community involvement, acknowledgment of potential local limitations, and financial planning to enhance its effectiveness and adaptability.},

	abstract = {Wildfires can pose profound threats to public safety. During escalated wildfire situations, communication among responding agencies is critically important, as is communication with the affected public. Telecommunication vulnerabilities to wildfire have been largely ignored in fire risk assessment and human dimensions research. This study examines telecommunications vulnerabilities to wildfire in Alberta, Canada, consisting of three objectives: (1) determine the extent of cell phone coverage in Alberta in relation to service demand areas (SDA's); (2) identify to what extent telecommunications infrastructure and SDA's are exposed to potential wildfire; and (3) identify SDA's that have high wildfire exposure and potentially limited cellphone coverage. We used a landscape fire exposure metric and communications viewshed to identify wildfire-exposed areas lacking cellular service within the Canadian province of Alberta. A directional vulnerability analysis highlighted the telecommunications infrastructure most at risk. Service demand areas (SDAs) prone to cellular coverage gaps (i.e., road and trail networks) were used to assess public safety implications. A patchwork of cellular coverage blankets the province, which is heavily influenced by population distribution and hindered by terrain. Communications towers frequently occur in locations with high wildfire exposure (n = 186) and individual towers are vulnerable to hundreds of potential fire pathways. Expansive areas along roadways and trail systems lack cell phone coverage in addition to being exposed to potential wildfire, posing a threat to public safety. These findings may inform future wildfire preparedness and mitigation plans, fuel reduction treatments, and telecommunications infrastructure improvements.},

ABSTRACT = {Portugal’s increasing wildfire frequency has led to home destruction, large areas burned, ecological damage, and economic loss, emphasizing the need for effective fire exposure assessments. This study builds on a Canadian approach to wildfire exposure and evaluates wildfire exposure in the Portuguese municipality of Mafra, using artificial territories (AT) as a proxy for the wildland–urban interface (WUI) and integrates land use land cover (LULC) data with a neighborhood analysis to map exposure at the municipal scale. Fire exposure was assessed for three fire transmission distances: radiant heat (RH, <30 m), short-range spotting (SRS, <100 m), and longer-range spotting (LRS, 100–500 m) using fine resolution (5 m) LULC data. Results revealed that while AT generally exhibited lower exposure (<16% “very high” exposure), adjacent hazardous LULC subtypes significantly increase wildfire hazard, with up to 51% of LULC subtypes classified as “very high exposure”. Field validation confirmed the accuracy of exposure maps, supporting their use in wildfire risk reduction strategies. This cost-effective, scalable approach offers actionable insights for forest and land managers, civil protection agencies, and policymakers, aiding in fuel management prioritization, community preparedness, and the design of evacuation planning. The methodology is adaptable to other fire-prone regions, particularly mediterranean landscapes.},
